3mm_ref - serial reference version
In practice:
t = 16.63 (best execution time)
IPC = 0.54
CacheMiss% = 5%

// This makes no sense because we don't use all 4 cores
3mm_sections - run A*B and C*D in parallel tasks
In theory:
s = 2 (Parallelized portion speedup)
p = 2/3 (Portion of the program that is parallelized)
S_e = 1.5 (Amdahl's law expected speedup)

In practice:
t = 12.97
S = 1.28 (actual speedup w.r.t. reference)
IPC = 0.46
CacheMiss% = 5%


3mm_parallel_matmuls - parallelize each matmul
In theory:
s = 4
p = 1
S_e = 4

In practice:
t = 5.15
S = 3.22
IPC = 0.45
CacheMiss% = 5%

Conclusion:
We're using all four cores and cache usage is optimal.
IPC is low => find out why
