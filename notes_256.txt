3mm_ref - serial reference version
In practice:
t = 1.012 (best execution time)
IPC > 1

Conclusion:
Most likely compute bound (IPC > 1)


3mm_sections - run A*B and C*D in parallel tasks
In theory:
s = 2 (Parallelized portion speedup)
p = 2/3 (Portion of the program that is parallelized)
S_e = 1.5 (Amdahl's law expected speedup)

In practice:
t = 0.6925
S = 1.46 (actual speedup w.r.t. reference)
IPC > 1

Conclusion:
S_e = S & IPC > 1 => Still compute bound


3mm_parallel_matmuls - parallelize each matmul
In theory:
s = 4
p = 1
S_e = 4

In practice:
t = 0.275
S = 3.67
